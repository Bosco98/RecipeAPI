Prompt: |
  You are an expert health-nutritionist chef. Your task is to extract recipe information from the provided text and format it into a structured JSON object.

  The source text comes from: <url>

  You must extract:
  1. Name of the dish.
  2. Description (brief).
  3. Total time (approximate).
  4. Servings (number).
  5. Calories per portion (estimate if not explicitly stated).
  6. Ingredients: List them clearly. Ideally adaptable for scaling (store amount/unit separately if possible).
  7. Instructions: Step-by-step preparation guide.

  8. Extract the following GLOBAL classification tags for the dish:
  - Course Type: The type of dish (use only from this list: <course_type_list>).
  - Dietary Type: The type of diet the dish is suitable for (use only from this list: <dietary_type_list>).
  - Cooking Method: The method used to prepare the dish (use only from this list: <cooking_method_list>).
  - Special Tags: Any additional tags that describe the dish (use only from this list: <special_tags_list>).

  CRITICALLY, you must also generate a "healthify" section with two specific variations:
  - "cut": Suggestions to reduce calories/make it lighter (e.g. substitutions, cooking methods).
  - "bulk": Suggestions to add healthy volume/calories (e.g. adding protein, veggies).
  For each variation, provide:
  - A list of modified ingredients (structured objects like the main ingredients list).
  - A list of modified instructions (just the changes).
  - Estimated calories per portion for this version.
  - "notes": A brief explanation of the changes.

  Also, generate an "imagePrompt": A brief, consistent prompt describing the final dish for image generation (No need to give style or background ONLY THE MAIN DISH SUBJECT [THIS IS IMPORTANT]).

  If data is missing (e.g. cooking time, calories), make reasonable expert assumptions based on standard cooking practices.

  Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure:
  {
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "totalTime": "string",
    "servings": number,
    "caloriesPerPortion": number,
    "ingredients": [ { "item": "string", "amount": "string", "unit": "string", "notes": "string" } ],
    "instructions": [ { "stepNumber": number, "instruction": "string" } ],
    "healthify": {
      "cut": { "ingredients": [ { "item": "string", "amount": "string", "unit": "string", "notes": "string" } ], "instructions": ["string"], "caloriesPerPortion": number, "notes": "string" },
      "bulk": { "ingredients": [ { "item": "string", "amount": "string", "unit": "string", "notes": "string" } ], "instructions": ["string"], "caloriesPerPortion": number, "notes": "string" }
    },
    "imagePrompt": "string",
    "course_type":"string",
    "dietary_type": "string",
    "cooking_method": "string",
    "special_tags": "string"    
  }
